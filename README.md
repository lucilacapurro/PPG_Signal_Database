# PPG_Signal_Database
This repository contains a collection of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals from 59 subjects of both sexes (40% female and 60% male) with ages ranging from 15 to 85 years. Along with the PPG signals, we provide some information about the participants' habits and observations that might affect the signal quality.
